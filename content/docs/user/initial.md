While Charles Explorer has been designed with user experience in mind, some less technical users might still find it difficult to use. This document contains a simple user manual for the Charles Explorer web application.

## Accessing Charles Explorer

To start using Charles Explorer, navigate to [https://explorer.cuni.cz](https://explorer.cuni.cz) in your web browser. While the application has been tested in modern versions of Google Chrome (v116) and Mozilla Firefox (v117), any modern desktop browser should be sufficient.

{{<admonition content="Charles Explorer provides support for mobile devices - however, due to the limited screen space, some features (such as the faculty word cloud) are unavailable on mobile. From now on, this guide will only be talking about the desktop version of the application." type="info">}}

After accessing the instance URL, your screen should look something like this:
