Current university systems face significant issues, such as outdated interfaces and poor user experiences. These systems often use old technology, making it difficult for students and faculty to navigate and access materials. This leads to frustration and inefficiency in learning. Modernization is crucial to create a smoother and more effective educational environment.

The goal of Charles Explorer is to create a modern, user-friendly, and efficient university search engine system.
